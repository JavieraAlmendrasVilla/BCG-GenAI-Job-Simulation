# 📊 Simulated AI-Powered Financial Chatbot

This project is a **prototype financial chatbot** built with **Python, Pandas, and Gradio**.
It uses predefined financial data (Apple, Microsoft, Tesla over 3 years) and allows users to interactively ask questions about key financial metrics such as **revenue, net income, assets, liabilities, and cash flow**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Responds to predefined financial queries:

  * 📊 Total revenue
  * 💰 Net income
  * 🏦 Total assets
  * 📉 Total liabilities
  * 💵 Cash flow from operations
* Supports **English** queries (e.g., *"What is the revenue?"*)
* Converts financial values into **clean numeric format** for calculations
* Runs with a **Gradio web interface**

---


## 📌 Limitations

* Only supports **predefined financial metrics** (no free-form financial analysis).
* Uses a **static dataset** (does not fetch real-time financial data).
* Simple **keyword-based detection** (not NLP-powered).

---

## 🏆 Future Improvements

* Add support for **growth metrics** (e.g., *"Revenue growth of Apple in 2023"*)
* Connect to a real **financial API** (e.g., Yahoo Finance)
* Improve **natural language understanding** with NLP models
